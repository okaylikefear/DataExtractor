# DataExtractor

**DataExtractor** is a mod for Minecraft that allows you to extract data from installed mods into convenient files on the client side. The goal of the mod is to provide a universal tool for extracting data from various mods and exporting it for further analysis, storage, or use.

Currently, the mod supports extracting data from popular mods like **CraftTweaker** and **BetterQuesting**, but future updates will expand its functionality to work with other mods.

This mod is built for **ForgeAPI 1.7.10** and **will NEVER** be ported to other versions. If you need it for another version, you will have to port it yourself.

## Features

- Extract data such as **ZenScript** scripts and quest data.
- Export data in convenient formats like **.zs** and **.json**.
- Create a folder to store extracted data.
- Support for future mod extensions to extract data from other popular mods.

## Compatible Mods

- **CraftTweaker** (for working with ZenScript)
- **BetterQuesting** (for extracting quest data)

The mod can also be extended to work with other mods in the future, with additional features and data export formats.

## Tested on projects
